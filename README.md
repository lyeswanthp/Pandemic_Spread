Analysis and Interpretation:
Infection Peak
In the SIR model, the infection apex I(t) typically occurs around day 40 due to high initial susceptibility, which correlates with increased transmission rates. The susceptible population S(t) depletion is a key factor in the peak's decline. Critical parameters govern the dynamics, such as R0, which quantifies secondary infections in a fully susceptible population. Additionally, spatial population distribution and interaction complexities between compartments significantly influence the epidemic's peak and trajectory.
Basic Reproductive Number R0:
β=0.3×10−3 and γ=0.1 R0​ is calculated as: R0=0.3×10−3/0.1=3
An R0 value > 1 indicates infectious disease spread within a population. Given R0=3, the potential for a substantial outbreak is high due to an average of three secondary infections per infected individual. Mitigation strategies, such as vaccination, social distancing, or enhanced recovery rates, are essential to reduce R0 and control the outbreak.
Pandemic Dynamics
The SIR epidemiological model exhibits a swift depletion of susceptibles as infections escalate, with the infected curve attaining a peak before descending as recoveries accumulate. This trend culminates in the recovered population dominating post-peak, indicating a shift towards herd immunity and diminished incidence of new infections. The model elucidates the pandemic's temporal dynamics of spread and control.

SEIR Model with Births and Deaths
Implementation and Simulation
The SEIR model, a fundamental epidemiological framework in disease modeling, includes an exposed compartment E(t) to represent the latency period post-exposure and pre-infectiousness. This addition refines the model's accuracy by addressing the temporal gap in disease transmission dynamics. Moreover, accounting for births and deaths in the model ensures the stability of the long-term population equilibrium, which is crucial for realistic and reliable epidemic forecasting.
Waves of the Pandemic
The SEIR epidemiological model manifests multifaceted infection waves stemming from the dynamic interplay of exposure and infectious periods. This temporal lag in transitions, coupled with continuous susceptible population replenishment via births, underpins the model's oscillatory nature. This mathematical framework emulates real-world infection patterns, capturing recurrent outbreaks as susceptibles are regenerated.
Effect of Birth/Death Rates
Birth and mortality rates are key determinants of systemic equilibrium in epidemiological models. An elevated birth rate inflates the susceptible population, which can either sustain or initiate novel infection waves. Conversely, increased death rates may attenuate disease severity via decreased population density. The exposed compartment acts as a buffer, smoothing out initial infection peaks but potentially elongating the pandemic's temporal span.

Sensitivity Analysis
Parameter Variations
Vary β from 0.1×10−3 to 0.5×10−3 and γ from 0.05 to 0.2 to observe changes in infection dynamics. Increased β parameters in infection models escalate spread rates, resulting in elevated and prompt peak incidences. Conversely, a higher γ parameter diminishes prevalence, thereby facilitating swifter epidemic decay.
Implications for Public Health
Lowering β via social distancing effectively flattens infection curves, mitigating healthcare system strain. Augmenting γ via medical progress decreases severity and duration of infections. Results highlight the significance of timely interventions and resource optimization in pandemic management.
